# 📮 THE API TESTER (The Digital Postcard)
# This file lets us talk to the backend directly, skipping the website (Frontend).
# It is useful for checking if the "Engine" works before we build the "Dashboard".
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# "###" tells the computer: "This is the start of a new request."
### Send a Test Payment

# 1. THE ACTION (POST)
# "POST" means: "I am SENDING new data to you."
# "http://localhost:8080..." is the ADDRESS of our running server.
POST http://localhost:8080/api/transactions

# 2. THE HEADER (The Language)
# We tell the server: "I am speaking in JSON format."
# If we don't say this, the server might think we are sending a PDF or an Image.
Content-Type: application/json

# 3. THE BODY (The Message)
# This is the actual data we want to send.
# It must match the "Transaction.java" fields exactly!
{
  "reference": "TEST-PAY-001",   # What is this payment for?
  "amount": 550.00,              # How much money?
  "currency": "ZAR",             # What currency?
  "senderAccount": "ACC-Bob",    # Who is paying?
  "receiverAccount": "ACC-Alice" # Who is getting paid?
}

# 🚀 HOW TO RUN THIS:
# 1. Make sure your App is running (Green Play Button in IntelliJ).
# 2. Look for a tiny "Run" ▶️ icon right next to the line "POST http://..."
# 3. Click it!
# 4. Watch the "Services" or "Run" tab at the bottom to see the server's reply.
